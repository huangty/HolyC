HOLYC: Huang-Liu's Openly LazY Controller
========
I. Overview

This controller is for controlling an openflow switch resides in an android phone. 
Right now, it's just a toy. Since we are openly lazy, it's still in its infancy. 

II. Code Structure

Currently, we have four packages:
1. net.holyc/: this is where the UI sits
2. net.holyc.host/: this is all the codes regarding to host environment setting
3. net.holyc.jni/: this is code for java-native interface. 
4. net.holyc.ofcomm/: this package handles the communication between the controller and the switch
5. net.beaconcontroller.packet/: this is the code for constructing and intrepreting packets. We openly steal this package from the Beacon Controller. 

III. Dependency

HOLYC depends on Android SDK (preferably 2.2 or above) and openflowj. 


IV. Compile

You can either use Eclipse or Command line (we use ant) to compile this project. 

Here is the instruction for using ant. 
1. To see all the target ant support, type 'ant help'
2. To compile, type 'ant compile'
3. To build apk file, type 'ant release'
4. To install or uninstall the apk file into the device, type 'ant install' or 'ant uninstall'
5. To clean up, type 'ant clean'
